a proof of concept about how a proper fs search engine must work on windows os.

- not privileged
- ultra fast, does 10 minute tasks of microsoft search tool under 5 seconds and while repeated task takes another 10 minutes with microsoft tool takes under 0.1 second with this
- searchs 1tb old hdd on 2010 era hw full of little garbages and fragmentation with around 50mb ram usage and low cpu usage
- a single exe and writes only one single xml file for normal settings
- no indexing garbage everything realtime.

some parts are not implemented but the core is ready for poc. for help use mouse hovering.

currently no source code is not because the code is secret only because it's simple. you can reverse engineer it anyways, is not obfuscated is not even packed.
